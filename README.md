# Schwert & Feder: ProcessWire Edition

As webmaster for the Swiss RPG/board-gaming club [Schwert & Feder](https://home.schwertundfeder.com/joomla/) one of my goals was to do a complete overhaul of the extremely aged website. The backend runs on Joomla and, while it's not clear to me what my predecessors did, exactly, somewhere along the line something got badly broken. It's running on badly outdated versions of PHP and Joomla, and files required for updates are simple... not present. I'm not sure how this happened, but sometimes the best thing to do it nuke it from orbit and start fresh.

Having put off the task for, frankly, ages, I finally decided to rewrite the site using [ProcessWire](https://processwire.com/), a CMS I use professionally. It's lightweight and fit for purpose: this is a relatively simple site that changes very infrequently, but when content needs to be added, I'd like the process to be as simple and user-friendly as possible. (And Joomla, frankly, is incomprehensible... though I've admitted no idea if the problem is due to Joomla, me, or whoever built the site in the first place.)
